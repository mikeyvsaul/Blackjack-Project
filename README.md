Blackjack
=====

_**Blackjack**_, sometimes known as _**21**_, is a popular card game that pits the player against the dealer. The goal of the game is to have a hand of cards that has a value that is equal to or as close to **21** as possible without going over that value. Going over **21** is known as a **_bust_**, and will count as a loss. 

The value of each card corresponds with their number, with face cards also counting as 10. The Ace cards are unique in that they are worth either **11** or **1**, depending on whichever value allows continued play without going bust. 

The player or dealer can get a "**_Blackjack_**" only during the initial deal and if they get an Ace along with a card worth 10. Getting a "**_Blackjack_**" is an automatic win, unless both have it, in which case it is a tie. 

After the initial deal of 2 cards each, and with no "**_Blackjack_**" from either the player or dealer, has the player start first. Both of the player's cards are visible, and they have a choice to either "**Hit**", which adds another card from the deck to their hand, or to "**Stand**", which ends their turn. One of the dealer's cards is always face down, so the player must decide whether they want to keep hitting to increase the value of their hand at the risk of going bust. A player can stand at any time as long they have not gone bust, in which case the dealer will start drawing cards until they hit a minimum hand value of **17**, maximum of **21**, or if they bust. 

In this version of the game, the game is played with a standard 52 card deck, though in most casinos, the game is usually played with multiple decks to make it more difficult for players to accurately guess which cards may come up next in order to beat the dealer.
